![text: (en) Something not so funny, difficult times come to us who use mobile operators to connect and work in Spare5. There was an increase in the cost of the mega from 0.47 to 4 Bss ( in my case Movistar). Tasks such as lidar with high consumption of megabytes (50mb) will generate losses, the cost to do thistask will be 4 Bss / MB x 50 = 200 Bss and the gane of $0.05 x 3000 Bss/$ = 150 Bss](./images/016.jpeg)
